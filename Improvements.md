# Improvements

* In the file with path 'vue-project-nootnoot/slim-skeleton/templates/index.phtml'
 There is CSS in the HTML code (the canvas tag). This should not happen, this should be in a sepperate CSS file.
 There is also JS in the HTML code, try to also make a JS file for this which you can link in the head, this makes the code cleaner.
